# v6.3.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/components` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds JSDoc comments to all components.

## Additional Notes

- This has been done to improve the developer experience, so the human-readable use case displays immediately in the editor.
- It also opens up the possibility of automating the documentation such that it can automatically generate documentation based on the JSDoc comments. That said, I know the main draw-in for components is the application on a website, and I don't think JSDoc comments can be used to generate a playground example of a React component just yet (unless I am wrong).
- In any case, whatever the approach to the documentation of this package will be, it will definitely replace the old `package-docs` site as it is currently very outdated and not really formatted in the best way.
